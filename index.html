    <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
      <p>In the current news coverage on the ongoing war in Nagorno-Karabakh, this region
 is often referred to as a
“disputed region” between Armenia and Azerbaijan and is claimed to be
internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but to be governed by ethnic
Armenians.  This statement is misleading and
misrepresents the reality about the origins and history of the region.</p>

<p>We would like to invite you to 
<a href="#get-to-know-artsakh">get to know Nagorno-Karabakh or Artsakh</a> to see 
that ethnic Armenians <a href="#history-of-artsakh">have inhabited these lands for
centuries, have created on these lands for centuries, have prayed on these lands
for centuries</a>. Our goal is to show that the people of Artsakh 
have never occupied or forcefully taken control of these lands, because as the Armenian President 
Armen Sarkissian put it <em>how can you occupy lands where you have been living for centuries?</em></p>

<p>Artsakh has a rich and long history, exceptionally beautiful landscape and a deep-rooted Christian tradition. Neither Azerbaijan nor any other Islamic culture may  have any territorial claims over Artsakh, be it for historical or political reasons. The people of Artsakh deserve to live peacefully and freely in their homes and this will only be
possible if the international community <a href="#why-recognize-the-republic-of-artsakh">recognizes the
Republic of Artsakh</a>
and lets the 
<a href="#the-right-to-self-determination-of-the-people-of-artsakh">people of Artsakh exercise their right to self-determination</a> – the only path towards preventing further deaths on both sides of the conflict and ensuring lasting peace in the region.</p>

<p>Please support our Change.org petition <a href="https://www.change.org/p/25361489/preview?source_location=homepage_large_button&amp;sulstate=authenticated&amp;lsrappv=control&amp;tag_selected=human_rights">It’s time to recognize the Republic of Artsakh!</a>.</p>

<p>Artsakh has been standing strong and proud for centuries. Have a look at this timeline from the website of <a href="https://www.eafjd.eu/nkr">The European Armenian Federation for Justice and Democracy</a> 
(ՀՅԴ Եւրոպայի Հայ Դատի Յանձնախումբ) to see how ancient and Armenian the history of Artsakh is:</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;" id="why-recognize-the-republic-of-artsakh">Why recognize the Republic of Artsakh?</h1>

<p />

<p>The painful past of wars and massacres and the Armenian Genocide of 1915 by the Ottoman Empire later to become Turkey are a constant reminder that the very existence of the Armenian race cannot be taken for granted.</p>

<h3 id="the-ongoing-war">The ongoing war</h3>

<p>On the early morning of September 27 and in the midst of a global pandemic, Azerbaijan launched a full-scale war on
Artsakh across the entire line of contact under the control of the armed forces
of the Republic of Artsakh, thus violating the ceasefire agreement signed
in 1994 <a class="citation" href="#bbcworldeurope">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Azerbaijani forces are making use of everything that modern weaponry
has to offer and do not shy away from using banned cluster bombs to attack
the civilian population in the capital Stepanakert and other regions of Artsakh, as evidenced by the Amnesty
International <a class="citation" href="#amnesty">[2], [3]</a>. As of 19 October 2020, dozens of civilians have died and more than 700 Armenian soldiers have fallen defending their home, their families, their culture and their statehood. Armenians mourn each one of these precious lives lost.</p>

<h3 id="the-role-of-turkey-and-its-global-implications">The role of Turkey and its global implications</h3>

<p>Azerbaijan has been openly and vehemently supported by Turkey and its
president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government has not only been deploying
troops and aircrafts to Azerbaijan but also recruiting Syrian and other terrorists to
fight against the Republic of Artsakh <a class="citation" href="#guardian">[4], [5], [6]</a>. 
The U.S. Department of State has recently warned its citizens against travelling to 
Azerbaijan citing terrorism concerns <a class="citation" href="#travelusa">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>While it has been widely accepted by the
international community that the Turkish president seeks to expand its control
in the region <a class="citation" href="#bbcflexing">[8]</a>, Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has warned on multiple occasions <em>that
this is a policy of continuing the Armenian genocide and a policy of reinstating
the Turkish empire</em> <a class="citation" href="#reuters-genocide">[9]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="civil-population-of-artsakh-and-its-heritage-under-attack">Civil population of Artsakh and its heritage under attack</h3>

<p>From day one of the war, Azerbaijani forces have targeted the civilian populated
areas of Artsakh, causing multiple casualties and destructions of houses,
schools, kindergartens, churches and vital infrastructure, leaving
people in shelters with no supply of water or electricity and depriving
thousands of children of their right to education
<a class="citation" href="#aljazeera">[10], [11], [12], [13]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="war-crimes-by-the-azerbaijani-military">War crimes by the Azerbaijani military</h3>

<p>Footage of Azerbaijani military’s brutal actions flooded the social media platforms during
the third week of the war, showing the ISIS style executions of Armenian
captives. The video footage with graphic imagery was deliberately sent by the Azerbaijani social network users to
Armenian users across different platforms, targeting especially young children
and women. The video footage has been investigated and verified by independent
digital investigation groups <a class="citation" href="#medium-execution">[14], [15]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-international-community">The international community</h3>

<p>On September 30, the French President Emmanuel Macron used some strong words to
describe the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh condemning the attacks launched
by Azerbaijan and the aggressive and destructive rhetoric of the Turkish
president Erdogan.  A number of parliaments across Europe have since adopted
resolutions condemning Azerbaijan
<a class="citation" href="#zartonk">[16]</a>, whereas the City Council of Milan <a class="citation" href="#matteo">[17]</a> has
gone a step further by recognizing the independence of the Republic of Artsakh.
Even though the Israeli government has been selling and continues to this day selling
deadly weaponry to Azerbaijan <a class="citation" href="#reutersisrael">[18]</a>, many Israelis have expressed their solidarity
with the Armenian people with whom they share a history of surviving persecution and genocide <a class="citation" href="#israelnews">[19]</a>.</p>

<p />

<p>Armenian communities across the world, formed mainly in the aftermath of the
Armenian Genocide by the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the twentieth century, have
taken it to the streets in multiple countries and cities to show their protest
against the lack of adequate response by their governments as well as media
coverage on the recent attacks on Armenians by Turkey and Azerbaijan. Many
Armenians living abroad have returned to their homeland to back the troops on
the ground, whereas others have shown their continued support on all social
media platforms despite the vicious attacks by the Azeri propaganda trolls 
<a class="citation" href="#nbcla">[20], [21], [22], [23]</a>.</p>
<p />

<hr />

<h1 style="text-align: center;" id="the-right-to-self-determination-of-the-people-of-artsakh">The right to self-determination of the people of Artsakh</h1>

<p>Azerbaijan justifies its violent attacks on Artsakh referring to the principle
of territorial integrity, disregarding the fact that Joseph Stalin’s decision to
place this region with an overwhelmingly Christian Armenian population under
its Soviet administration back in 1921 was arbitrary and against the will of the people of Artsakh.</p>

<p>The people of Artsakh base their claim to independence on their right to
self-determination under public international law, their right to liberty and their right to live freely
without being discriminated, persecuted and massacred on lands that have been
their home for centuries. The people of Artsakh effectively exercised this right
back in 1991 by holding a referendum and declaring their independence, in which
82% of all voters participated and 99% voted for independence <a class="citation" href="#vote">[24]</a>. On a side note,
in that same year Azerbaijan had declared its own independence from the Soviet
Union, based on that very same right to self-determination <a class="citation" href="#azerbaijan">[25]</a> the validity of
which it has been fiercely contesting since then. Moreover, in response to the
referendum of the people of Artsakh, Azerbaijan organized a series of massacres
of ethnic Armenians, continuing on the genocidal path of its Turkish
ancestors <a class="citation" href="#asbarez">[26]</a>.</p>

<p>The right of peoples to self-determination is guaranteed by the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and constitutes a well-known principle under public international law. This right, in the case of the Republic of
Artsakh, is especially vital in the face of the grave violations of human and
minority rights by Azerbaijan in the past, and the grave violations of human
rights and the war crimes that are taking place in this ongoing war. Being part of Azerbaijan is
not an option for the people of Artsakh, it is suicidal. These people have an
inherent right to live on these lands peacefully and freely without the constant fear of being massacred.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Verify your sources: Azerbaijan is an oppressive and corrupt dictatorship <a class="citation" href="#fhouse">[27]</a>, controlled by the Aliyev family. The government has blocked almost all social media and communication platforms and has banned the entry of foreign journalists into the country. The
rare international journalists working on the ground are under the tight control
of the Azerbaijani police and Government. 
<br />Do not fall victim to Azerbaijani propaganda, Azerbaijani troll factories <a class="citation" href="#buzzfeed">[28]</a>
which employ thousands of fake pages and accounts to disseminate
false information, and beware of Aliyev family lobbying schemes <a class="citation" href="#occrp">[29], [30]</a>.</li>
